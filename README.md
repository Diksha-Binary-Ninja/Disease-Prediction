# **Disease Prediction & Kidney X-ray Classification**  
### *A Machine Learning & Deep Learning Project for Hackathon*  

## 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project includes two AI-driven healthcare solutions:  
1. **Disease Prediction:** Users enter symptoms, and the model predicts the most probable disease.  
2. **CNN-based Kidney X-ray Classification:** A deep learning model classifies kidney X-ray images into four categories: *Normal, Cyst, Stone, Tumor*.  

---

## 🚀 **Features**  
✔️ Predict diseases based on symptoms using machine learning.  
✔️ Classify kidney X-ray images using a CNN model.  
✔️ User-friendly and interactive interface.  
✔️ Supports real-time X-ray image input for kidney disease detection.

## 🛠 **Installation**  

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/disease-kidney-classification.git
cd disease-kidney-classification
```

### 2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**  
Make sure you have Python installed (Recommended: Python 3.8+).  
Run the following command to install required libraries:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ **Prepare Dataset**  
- For disease prediction, ensure `dataset.csv` is placed in the project directory.  
- For kidney disease classification, prepare your dataset with X-ray images and organize them into folders (`Normal, Cyst, Stone, Tumor`).

## 🔥 **Usage**  

### **1. Disease Prediction (Based on Symptoms)**  
Run the script:  
```bash
python disease_prediction.py
```
Then, enter symptoms when prompted (comma-separated), e.g.,  
```
Enter symptoms: fever, cough, headache
```
The system will predict the disease based on entered symptoms.  

---

### **2. Kidney Disease X-ray Classification**  
Run the CNN model:  
```bash
python kidney_classification.py --image "path/to/your/image.jpg"
```
The system will analyze the X-ray and predict whether the kidney condition is:  
✅ *Normal*  
⚠️ *Cyst*  
⚠️ *Stone*  
⚠️ *Tumor*
